# xmake packages for some package managers

See [docs](docs) for python and nodejs. For lua, see [template.rockspec](template.rockspec).

Notice luarocks.org doesn't host
[binary rock files](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Hosting-binary-rocks).
So if you add `xmake` to `build-dependencies`, you still have to tolerate
troublesome of building xmake.

## Misc

[Wiki](https://github.com/xmake-io/xmake-wheel/wiki) lists some wheels which
provide binary programs.
